# IOT Garden Tool
_by Hyunrae Kim and Joel Ki_

A project that helps garden hobbyists maintain a healthy garden. The tool includes measurement hardware such as a soil moisture sensor, temperature probe, and a PIR sensor to help busy users monitor their garden remotely. A main focus of this project was to keep wildlife away from the home garden. By detecting motion with the PIR sensor, the tool can use sound, motion, or light to scare wildlife automatically.
